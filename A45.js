// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly

        this.manufacturerName = maufacturerName;
        this.modelNumber = modelNumber;
        this.color = color;
    }
    return Car;
