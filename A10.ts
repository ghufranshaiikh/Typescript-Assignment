// Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

// this is my first program

let name2 = "Eric";
console.log("Hello" + name2 + "would you like to learn some python today?");

// this is my 5th program

let famousperson1 = "Allama iqbal once said,";
 let famousquote1 = `"Nations are born in the hearts of poets, they prosper and die in the hands of politicians"`;
   console.log(`${famousperson1} ${famousquote1}`);
